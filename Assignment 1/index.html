     <h2>Mission Statement/Goals</h2>

     <h2>Inspiration</h2>
        <p>The website that I am wanting to replicate is created by Gary Tallent. It showcases his Albums, shows, about him, where to watch, and how to connect. I also love the layout of the website and how it flows. I want to use a lot of imagery but make it simplisitc like this website exemplifies. </p>
